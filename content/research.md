Since 2022 I am pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at the Czech Technical University in Prague, Faculty of Electrical Engineering. I have succesfully defendended my thesis proposal in 2024 with the topic of *Beyond Discriminative Learning in Financial Transaction Data*.

I am closely cooperating with the czech start-up ResistantAI. My research is focused on modeling of financial transaction data, fraud detection and money laundering prevention. I am interested in change of behavior, anomaly detection, explainability and human-in-the-loop interaction between machine learning detection models and compliance analysts.
