description = "Hello. My name is Michaela, and I am a chaotic 28-year-old PhD student, researcher, ultimate frisbee player, book lover, writer, thinker, runner, and just overall a chaotic ADHD mess of a person. I love to do everything, I love to learn new things, but usually, I actually forget whatever I've learned. Even though that makes my life hard, I love my chaotic self and I want to share with you a few of these life adventures."

## What I am doing

So, there's this text that I am writing and I am testing how it all behaves on different sizes of the websites in the browser. I need to see if the text is aligned properly and also I want to style the headings to look nicer. To be honest, the CSS is bothering me.
