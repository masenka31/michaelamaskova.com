Hello. My name is Michaela, and I am a chaotic 28-year-old PhD student, researcher, ultimate frisbee player, book lover, writer, thinker, runner, and just overall a chaotic ADHD mess of a person. I love to do everything, I love to learn new things, but usually, I actually forget whatever I learned. Even though that makes my life hard, I love my chaotic self and I want to share with you a few of these life adventures.

This site serves as a blog and portfolio. It should include everything necessary for you to contact me, to learn more about me, and maybe find some inspiration in whatever field you might be interested in.
